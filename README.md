> Data Science Enthusiast, Self Learner, Problem solver

My goal is to help the peoples to solve their real time problems just use their data's. Data's are the voices of problems. That's why, playing with data's are always a fantastic job as a data scientist, but you have to be very serious about your data. Because a single data can change the way of your problem solution. Do not worry, BE COOL ...
