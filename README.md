> Data Science Enthusiast <br/>
> Self Learner, Problem solver

DATA SCIENCE can help me to reach my GOAL. Goal is simple but may be the path is long and hard to reach or not. But I am really not worried about the obstacles. I want to help the peoples to solve their real time problems just use their data's. Data's are the voices of problems. That's why, playing with data's are always a fantastic job as a data scientist but you have to be very serious about your data. Because a single data can change the way of your problem solution. Do not worry, BE COOL.
